this is an almost finished and totally not polished re-implementation of the binary search tree project from mod 1.  written in C++

[project spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Since the project is so simple, you can just use g++ to compile and run the main file, which is a "test" of sorts.

* clone the project: `$ git clone git@github.com:jdliss/bst-cpp.git`

* cd into the directory `$ cd bst-cpp`

* to run the "test file": `$ g++ main.bst bst.cpp node.cpp`
